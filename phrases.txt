bullet with butterfly wings
from the cradle to enslave
hallowed be thy name
run to the hills
i want it all
welcome to the jungle
november rain
killer queen
we will rock you
loath to refuse
last train to london
shoot to thrill
thunder struck
brainstorm
show me how to live
your time has come
iron man
paranoid
summer forgive me
